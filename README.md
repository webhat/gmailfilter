Google MailFilter Proof of Concept
==================================

Installation
============
Currently it needs te be installed in a local directory, and the XSL transformation must be run before it does anything.

How it Works?
=============
The mailfilter.html is called in the browser, and creates an overview of the rules. The column _Label_ can be clicked to
see all the rules associated with that label, and other labels with the same name - it highlights each of the labels
with a colour code for clarity. The label can be double clicked to perform the search in GMAil associated with the
label.

The rules can be clicked to edit them.
